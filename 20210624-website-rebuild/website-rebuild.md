Techbits.io has had a few iterations over the years, and as a bit of a COVID project, I started rebuilding the whole thing from scratch.

It's still a bit of a work in progress, but now *mostly* ready.

I plan to go into detail regarding some of the (in my opinion) cooler bits of the architecture, as well as gradually adding in some old-but-relevant posts from the before-times.

The [about](https://techbits.io/about) and [privacy](https://techbits.io/privacy) pages cover a bit of stuff, as well as the repo [README.md](https://github.com/techbitsio/techbits.io).

Comments and (especially) suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
